To recap, I've already spoken about what the project is about kind of from a high level right and the various little components that were needed to solve the problem that I was trying to solve. 
My initial plan was that I was going to talk some more about what I did for each small individual piece but It's been so long since I did it and I've taken such a long break from writing that I kind of think maybe adding a link to the video should be enough. So check out the video here[^1]. 
In there you'll see me talk through the entire thing and how it works in it's entirety. 

I've been going through the hardest week in my life and I feel like this is a good opportunity to start writing again and getting more productive than I used to. It's weird that it's actually in the moments when you don't want to do something that you should actually do it because it teaches your brain to do things regardless of how difficult or hard it feels in the moment. 

Anyway, that aside, there's now a part of the entirety of the research that I want to focus on. 
This is the part where I realised that I had actually made a mistake and was trying to solve the problem from a wrong angle. And I say this to some extent in the video that I've linked but I'd want to go a bit into details on that portion.

### It wasn't a waste of time was it? 
So getting to the end of me working on my thesis I realised what the true goal of the research was. It was to make it such that learning is maximized in the context of watching programming video tutorials. You maximize retention and understanding by making it easy for tutorial watchers to interact with the code content inside of the tutorial. Things like questions that they need to answer, specific portions of the code that they need to complete and fixing bugs increase learning alot when it comes to programming. Even though my solution made it easy(to some extent) for them to get access to the programming tutorial videos and then experiment with them(which increases learning) it didn't add anything beyond just giving access to the code and didn't add much that couldn't already be gotten by tutorial makers deciding to upload their source code. It was fun, don't get me wrong, but I feel the engine I built would be much useful being applied to another scenario and not this one in particular. I digress. 

The point I'm trying to make is, I think it would be more useful, for coding tutorials if there was a different kind of video format where the tutorial watchers could edit the code inside of the video as the tutorial went on. Or answer questions inside of the video as the tutorial went on. Something that made the video more interactive and elicited real learning. I feel that would do alot more for computer science and coding education than what mine did and that's what I want to hammer on. The idea isn't really polished and it's also kind of finicky. It actually might not work and might be too much effort for too little gains. I don't know. But currently I'm thinking around something of the sort. Possibly for a PHD in the future and possibly a patent. Don't steal my idea please. 

Yeah so that's all for today. 
I'll try and keep these short so that I want to write them more and more. 
See you next week(my 0 readers lolx)
