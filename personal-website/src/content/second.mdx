I decided to start wrigin a blog as a way to reason about my thoughts and ideas. 

From reading [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) I learnt about the importance of taking notes. I used to be an avid not taker when I was in Junior High School. I wrote aggresive notes as the teacher taught. 

In University, not so much. I was focused more on listening as the lecturer spoke. 
I think that because of that I started undermining the use of notes. "The human brain isn't capable of multitasking". As true as that statement is it doens't mean that not taking is a bad tool. 

I think I realise from reading the book that, you take notes for your future self. The way that not exists nowadays in the cloud to be exact, allows you to literally have a "second brain".
