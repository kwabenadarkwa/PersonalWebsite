When I was in my 4th year in uni, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Well it was during my 3rd year holidays
when I was interning. I was just getting into programming at that point and I think I would have had 
way more growth if I hadn't been able to use ChatGPT as such an early point in my career.

Anyway, I used it for a while and I should say that during that time my coding skills plateaued and even reduced.
I wish I hadn't. Or maybe I wish I had known the best way to use it to learn at such an early point in my career.
So let's say for a whole year, all the projects I built were directly using AI and not coding anything myself.
I think to a high extent I understood things from a higher level but the intricate process of build from the ground up
myself and then iterating on design is something that I didn't do. 

Later on, one of my friends, [Paul](https://github.com/paglobal) convinced me to start using `nvim`.
This led me to watching [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) which then made me realise the 
folly in my ways. So I stopped using AI completely. Let's say for a year and a half or so. During my masters I learnt
what I was supposed to have learnt. Building from the ground up and iterating on the design.

Learning this made me want to always code. That's exactly what I had been missing. 
It gave me a way to think through problems and not to get overwhelmed with all the complexities in the beginning of the process
of building. The image above is an illustration of how it works so I don't really have to go into detail.
It kind of works like this; let's say I want to build a phone right? I'll first design the higher level architecure of the 
entire thing. Do some preliminary research on the various components the phone would need. Then build those individual
components in their most basic and ignorant form. Once I have something that kind of works, I'll investigate each of the components that I've built and then ask my self what I can make better with all of these components. So I basically figure out 
what the best design for the phone I'm trying to build is by iterating and continually measuring various parts of the "phone" 
that need some improvement. This is kind of a summary of how I think about building things.

## What I do now.
Now I've been incorporating AI into this process. I don't know anything different. 
But with the process I've described above, I use AI to, if you'd like, make the process of iteration faster. 
I almost never use it to generate code and the entire design but come up with the design with it. Kind of like a pair programming session. For one-off things that I'm not going to be using or aren't going to be going to production I completely "vibe-code" it.
But for more important things for work for instance I do that same thing that I would have done if I was doing it myself, I'm just able to do it faster now(how much faster I don't know). I make sure that every single line of code I ship is something that I understand. I make sure to think about the security implications of every line that I ship. 

I try and stay away from completely generating code with AI unless is something I KNOW FOR SURE that I can do myself. That's the rule I have now. Otherwise I'm never going to actually learn how to do the thing. If I can't I go through the process of struggle to learn it myself, of course hastened by the AI. 

My thoughts on AI making the playing field the same for all programmers is that. If that were really the case, then wouldn't it be the case that all people would be able to create the same type of product based on prompting alone? What I mean is that, if different people, trying to build the same thing, using the same LLM can come up with different results, then the differentiating factor has to be the people themselves. 

Which means that, having skills is still very very very important. Unlike the internet people would like you to think. 

Anyway, that's how I like to think about it..... but what do I know? I'm just a junior.
