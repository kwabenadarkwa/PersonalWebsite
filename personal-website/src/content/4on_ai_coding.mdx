When I was in my 4th year in uni, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Well it was during my 3rd year holidays
when I was interning. I was just getting into programming at that point and I think I would have had 
way more growth if I hadn't been able to use ChatGPT as such an early point in my career.

Anyway, I used it for a while and I should say that during that time my coding skills plateaued and even reduced.
I wish I hadn't. Or maybe I wish I had known the best way to use it to learn at such an early point in my career.
