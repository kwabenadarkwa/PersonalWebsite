I decided to start writing a blog as a way to reason about my thoughts and ideas. 
From reading <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/" className="text-[#18A34B]">Building a Second Brain</a> I learnt about the importance of taking notes. 

### Context
I used to be an avid note taker when I was in Junior High School. I wrote aggresive notes as the teacher taught. In University, not so much. I was focused more on listening as the lecturer spoke. I think I undermined the use of taking notes because of that. "The human brain isn't capable of multitasking". As true as that statement is it doesn't mean that note taking is a bad tool. I think the best option is actively listening/reading, and then taking notes on the concepts that have deeply resonated with you.

I think I realise from reading the book that, you take notes for your future self. It's not necessarily how I used to do it in high school. 
Back then the thought was, "take notes so that you can remember them more when you need it in the future". I think now it's more, "take notes so that anywhere you need that piece of knowledge it can be easily acessible because the cloud exists and you can configure things such that you can always have them with you". I know that seems like a very long quote but that's literally what a brain is. It's always with you. Phones and devices are always with us which makes them kind of an extension of ourselves(a second brain.. lol). This is kind of the concept of a <a href="https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/" className= "text-[#18A34B]">zettlekasten</a> as it is called(at least the way I understand it). 

### Personal Development
Even though the personal notes that I take are stored safely for my private use , I think it's a good habit to put my thoughts about technical concepts online so that if I'm wrong about something I can be corrected as soon as possible. This reminds me of a quote I've heard multiple times: "The purpose of thinking is to let the ideas die instead of us dying" ~ 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10092515-the-purpose-of-thinking-is-to-let-the-ideas-die" className="text-[#18A34B]">Alfred North Whitehead</a>. I was scared to get things wrong and that's what detered me from putting my thoughts about concepts in public. I've come to understand that getting things wrong isn't really what matters. Being curious(which is basically my entire personality), and continuing to seek new knowledge about things trumps what it feels like to be wrong about something. At least in the sense that you don't stay in your lack of knowledge for too long. Reframing the way I think about getting things wrong is what is helping me get over this slump. I don't mind being wrong about things so far as I get corrected and learn from the experience. Don't get me wrong it'll affect my ego but my future self, KD in the future, would be very thankful to whoever gives me that information. 

Also I'm trying to get more articulate about the things I know I know. Sometimes I think I know something till I actually try saying it out loud to someone. Literally me (for both stories and technical concepts) ->

The tendency to get into a kind of word-salad because of the amount of concepts I try to wrangle up when I'm communicating them becomes very high if I haven't communicated that particular concept to people and refined my delivery over time. So, to prevent that from happening too often, and I know it'll happen again and again, I have decided to give my thoughts more release time by actively writing about them. Hopefully that should remove my word salad tendencies that occur from trying to wrangle too much information together in the delivery of a concept.


### TL;DR
Well not really a TL;DR but I didn't want to use "Conclusion" title. Anyway, I guess that sets the pace for the rest of what I'm going to be talking about (projects I build, things I learn ...etc). I will get things wrong. I don't care if I do. I hope I learn from my mistakes. I hope to get better at writing and articulating complex concepts in an easy to understand and digestable format. 


### Extras(read if you want to find out how to set up a "Second Brain" using Obsidian and Github)
Because I love nvim. I use nvim btw. I set up a second brain using <a href="https://obsidian.md/" className="text-[#18A34B]">Obsidian</a> and Github. I love the fact that it has vim motions and that makes it pretty easy to navigate and not miss my nvim config too much. I tried using the <a href="https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim" className="text-[#18A34B]">obsidian </a> plugin but it doesn't allow me to use Excalidraw and view images and that's something that I want my notetaking application to have so I just stuck with Obsidian with the vim plugin installed.This is a great video for setting up nvim with the obsidian plugin(even though I mostly actually just use Obsidian).
